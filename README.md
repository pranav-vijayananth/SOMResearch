# SOM Research
Collection of Google Colabs and datasets that I wrote/used when researching SOM (Self-Organizing Maps) underneath Professor Iulian Neamtiu at NJIT.

The datasets folder only has a sample of the CSV files used for training/testing the SOM models. The research was conducted with other 100 open-source datasets. 

Reserach paper was presented at the 2021 IEEE CISOSE   â¬‡
